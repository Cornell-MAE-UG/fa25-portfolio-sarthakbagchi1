For a class, we were asked to design a frame to lift the maximum possible weight the highest possible height given a 150 cm x 50cm 2d space, an actuator of my choice, a rigid bar and 3 pins. I decided to make a pinned beam design that is powered by a pinned actuator. The two are connect by a pin. This image shows the beam in two configurations -- the actuator retracted and extended.
