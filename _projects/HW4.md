For a class, we were asked to design a frame to lift the maximum possible weight the highest possible height given a 150 cm x 50cm 2d space, an actuator of my choice, a rigid bar and 3 pins. I decided to make a scissor lift design that is powered by a high force actuator to allow a larger weight to be lifted higher with great stability.
